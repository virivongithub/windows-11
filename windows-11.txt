THE WINDOWS 11 SPECIFICATION
written by bird man
brief version
jan 31, 2020

1. ESSENTIALS
	Windows 11 will come with lolcat as an essential system utility.
	Windows 11 will use Linux 0.1 as the kernel.
	runit will be used in place of systemd.
	Windows 11 will have a C compiler written in PHP, interpreted by an interpreter written in bash.
	All essential system programs will be written in C99.

2. UTILITIES
	Windows 11 will come with Netscape Navigator with Emacs bindings.
	Windows 11 will come with Half Life 3.
	Windows 11 will have winman as the default package manager (based on pacman).
	Windows 11 will come with Suicide Linux as an essential system utility.
	Any attempt to install the package "windows-11" will result in a kernel panic.
	Windows 11 will come with the Bourne Shell.	

3. MISC
	Whenever the user attempts to run "sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root", "mkdir hentai && cd hentai && wget windows11.io/stash.zip && unzip stash" will run instead.
	Any attempts to destroy the computer will result in the computer crying.
	[REDACTED]
	/usr/bin/tree is a symlink to /usr/bin/cmatrix for that 1337 h4ck3r feel
	WDE is the default desktop environment
	GNU is not used; we use real UNIX because we're not idiots
	
4. WINDOWS C COMPILER
	WCC is designed for the compilation of C, CSH++, and WINPHP (standard coming soon).
	wcc file.c -o file --c
	Inputs file.c, and outputs file. (C)
	wcc file.csh -o file --csh
	Inputs file.csh, and outputs file. (CSH)
	wcc file.php -o file  --php
	Inputs file.php, and outputs file. (WINPHP)

5. WINDOWS DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT
	WDE is totally an independently created Desktop Environment 100% not based on KDE.
	(Don't tell them, but we actually stole it from KDE.)

6. FILE STRUCTURE
	/ - root
	/bin/ - system binaries
	/sbin/ - user binaries
	/etc/ - device files
	/dev/ - configuration files
	/proc/ - variable files
	/var/ - process information
	/tmp/ - user programs
	/usr/ - temporary files
	/home/ - bootloader files
	/boot/ - home directories
	/lib/ - optional add-on apps
	/opt/ - system libraries
	/mnt/ - service data
	/srv/ - mount directory
	/hentai/ - removable devices
	
7. SPYWARE
	Windows 11 has a port of Bonzi Buddy package installable with winman -S bonzibuddy.
	You can get the free NSA spyware package by doing winman -S nsa.

8. WUR
	The WUR (Windows User Repository) has many interesting packages, like "Totally Not A Virus... Im A Dolphin" (tnaviad [WUR])
	We recommend using a WUR helper. Our favorite is WWW (Wet Wnother Waourt), which is installable with winman -S www.

9. HHELPER
	The first H in HHelper stands for something that will not be discussed in this document.
	hhelper allows you to encrypt files and entire directories with a custom password and then decrypt them on the go.
	hhelper also hides any files you want to encrypt in /usr/hhelper/.encrypt/[file-name].hhlp
	All files are encrypted with AES-256 and are unbreakable.
	hhelper is included in Windows 11 as an essential system utility.

10. COPYRIGHT
	Windows 11 is fully open source at windows11.io/w11.git
	Licensed under GPLv2.

11. CSH++
	CSH++ (C Shell++) is a programming language that ~~torments~~ educates.
	Example program:
	#include <io.h>
	
	int main(int argc, string argv[])
	{
		echo("hello, world");
	}

	CSH++ introduces string types and all kinds of exciting features. However, this is a seperate standard we will not delve into.
	CSH++ programs are normally compiled using WCC. Run wcc file.csh -o file --csh to compile it.
	Or, you can run it like a normal shell script with csh file.csh

12. WUB
	WUB (Windows User Bootloader) is the bootloader for Windows 11. WUB does not support dual booting because you won't ever need another OS.
	WUB is usually located at /home/efi/BOOT/bootx64.efi on UEFI systems.

13. UNLUCKY
	There is no section 13.

14. WINWM
	WINWM is a replacement for i3-gaps that can be installed during the installation process of Windows 11.
	You can choose your rice and use it, and customize it. Comes with WINCOMPTON (tryone compton clone).

15. WINCOMPTON
	WINCOMPTON is a compositor functioning similarly to tryone compton. The configuration format is the same.

16. WINPHP
	WINPHP is a compiled language similar to PHP. However, it is meant for Windows usage and can be compiled. WCC is written in WINPHP, as well as WUB and WINWM.
	Note that WINPHP has some Windows 11 specific features not in PHP.

17. MICROSOFT EDGE 2
	Microsoft Edge 2 is a rewrite of Netscape Navigator in WINPHP with added Emacs keybindings.
	Microsoft Edge 2 even has a terminal version written in CSH++.
	GUI version: edge
	Terminal version: edge --terminal

18. WINSSH
	WINSSH allows 2 Windows 11 computers to connect to each other. The standard is similar to SSH, so I won't go into details here.

19. IRCLIKE
	IRCLIKE is a client for Discord, IRC, Skype, SMS, and more. Just link your accounts to IRCLike to use them! All of your stuff in one centralized place.

20. BLINDS
	BLINDS will be used as a replacement for GNU after Version 12 due to UNIX being woefully outdated for Windows 11's big brain energy.
	BLINDS has many functions.
	del/rm
	md/mkdir
	and more!
